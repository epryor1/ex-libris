# Ex Libris
#Personal Library Tracker

An Apple app to manage your home library. Created in Swift Playgrounds.

I used Swift Playgrounds because it is what I have access to and I can still create an app for my phone. 

Features:
 Add books to your book shelf. Includes Title, Author,         page count

Background: 
I wanted to build an app to log the books I own in my home library. In future builds will add the ability to add a book cover and move storage from local storage to CoreData.

What I learned:
The main thing I was trying to learn was app development, version control, and deployment of a finished project.
Currently working on the last two, but building the app was a great experience in how quickly I could pick up a new language by leveraging my current skills and experience.
My main challenge was adding the ability to add a picture of the cover, and that is still underdevelopment, but I am optimistic I can get it implemented.


## Installation

You can download the zip file to your iPad and open it directly into swift playgrounds. 

## Credits
I used the included Swift Playgrounds tutorials to learn and build my app.
